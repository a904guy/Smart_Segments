# Krita Smart Segments Plugin Design Document

## Overview
Krita Smart Segments is an AI-powered segmentation tool designed for the graphics program Krita. It leverages GPU acceleration to perform efficient segmentation tasks and is structured to support multi-platform compatibility across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Goals and Key Requirements

- **Multi-Platform Compatibility:** Reliable operation on Windows, macOS, and Linux by using cross-platform functions and libraries from the outset.
- **GPU Acceleration with CPU Fallback:** Primary focus on GPU usage for heavy computations with a seamless CPU fallback.
- **Iterative Development and Codebase Evolution:** Build incrementally with frequent cycles of testing, feedback, and refinement.
- **Continuous Integration & Automated Releases:** Use CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and releases, leveraging tools like GitHub Actions.

## Development Strategy
1. **Project Setup and Environment Configuration**
    - Choosing Python for its cross-platform nature and extensive AI/ML libraries.
    - Set up dependencies and ensure consistent library versions across platforms.
    - Initialize a git repository for version control.
    - Create a modular project structure to enhance maintainability.
    
2. **Cross-Platform Development Best Practices**
    - Use of cross-platform path operations and abstractions to prevent platform-specific pitfalls.
    - Regular testing on all target platforms.

3. **GPU Acceleration and CPU Fallback Implementation**
    - Implement reliable GPU detection methods with libraries like PyTorch.
    - Write computational routines that adapt to either CPU or GPU efficiently.
    - Ensure performance-critical tasks are prioritized for GPU execution.

4. **Iterative Implementation of Core Features**
    - Break down core functionalities into smaller tasks.
    - Develop incrementally with a focus on maintaining code quality.
    - Leverage user or stakeholder feedback after achieving milestones.

5. **Testing and Quality Assurance**
    - Implement unit, integration, and performance testing.
    - Address robustness by testing edge cases and error conditions.
    - Use code quality tools like linters where applicable.

6. **Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**
    - Enable a CI pipeline to automate builds, tests, and releases.
    - Utilize GitHub Actions for automated release processes on all platforms.
    - Monitor CI results to address failures and ensure quality.

7. **Documentation and Finalization**
    - Produce user and developer documentation for installation and usage.
    - Maintain a changelog to record changes and updates.
    - Conduct a final audit to ensure cross-platform compatibility before release.

## Execution Plan Summary
- **Environment Preparation:** Install necessary tools, set up directories, confirm GPU drivers.
- **Project Initialization:** Create project structure, implement an entry point, and commit initial code.
- **Cross-Platform Foundation:** Replace placeholders with cross-platform methods and test.
- **GPU Detection Mechanism:** Establish GPU detection routines and test across compute environments.
- **Implement Core Features Iteratively:** Develop, test, push changes, and verify on CI.
- **Continuous Integration Feedback Loop:** Use CI results to guide development progress.
- **Prepare for Release:** Bump version numbers, update documentation, and finalize the release.
- **Automate Release with CI:** Trigger the release process using CI tools and ensure multi-platform distribution.

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for developing the Krita Smart Segments plugin, ensuring robustness, efficiency, and maintainability across platforms.
